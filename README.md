Dalamud-based FFXIV addon to improve the First Person Camera.
This plugin changes the the Camera to be bound to the players head bone and there are two optional settings to add the head bones rotation to the camera rotation (When the players head turns the camera turns with it - makes emotes more immersive)

It also stops making characters invisible when too close to the camera allowing you to see your own body when in first person.

Download Instructions:
Copy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TiraesiascenGraven/POVPlus/main/repo.json into Dalamud Custom Plugin Repository.

It will then appear under the name "POV+" in the All Plugins list

TODO LIST / KNOWN BUGS
FOV Slider applies to third person after leaving first person
The / command needs to be renamed
An optional button to disable the camera in third person needs to be added (and maybe FOV too)
